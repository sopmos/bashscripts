# bashscripts

### **Hello! Welcome to my GitHub page!**

F(L)OSS is my passion, and so I created this page to contain every bit of usable code I write. Here's to hoping SOMEONE finds <br>
something here that's of use to them! Please let me know if there's anything that I can do better! I'm always more than happy <br>
to help in any way I can. Feel free to fork and modify as you please, just remember to give credit! <3

**This repository is specifically for the Bash scripts that I've written and use regularly. ALL Bash scripts posted here will <br>
be listed under the GPL v3 license, as that is what Bash itself uses.**
